**Contentmunch Parent POM** for standardizing the build, dependency management, and plugin configuration across all contentmunch projects.

## Overview

This project defines a parent POM for the contentmunch ecosystem, providing:

- Centralized dependency management via BOMs.
- Shared plugin configuration (compiler, source, javadoc, GPG signing).
- Modules support.
- Java 21 compatibility.

## Modules

This parent project currently includes:

- contentmunch-bom
- contentmunch-foundation-spring-boot-starter
- contentmunch-auth-spring-boot-starter

## How to Use

In your Maven project, set `contentmunch-parent` as the parent:

```xml
<parent>
  <groupId>com.contentmunch</groupId>
  <artifactId>contentmunch-parent</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</parent>
```
This gives your project:
* Java 21 setup
* Centralized dependency versions
* Automatic source/javadoc jars
* GPG signing support
* Plugin configurations
* Compatibility with Maven Central publishing (via Sonatype)

## Dependency Management

The parent imports:
* Spring Boot BOM
* OpenTelemetry BOM
* contentmunch-bom for internal library version alignment

These ensure all projects use compatible dependency versions out of the box.
